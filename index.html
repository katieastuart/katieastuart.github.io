            <section id="bio">
                <p>Katie Stuart grew up in Fresno, California swimming and reading the days away. After attending Brigham Young University, where she received a Bachelors Degree in History, she started working at Ancestry and grew to love Utah. At Ancestry she worked for four years with the historical databases and helped enabled users to make personal and valuable discoveries about their family history. In 2015 she transitioned into a role managing the onsite experience for Marketing campaigns and promotions. In her free time Katie still loves swimming and reading, but also dabbles in Netflix watching and planning elaborate European vacations - a few sheâ€™s actually gone on. She is weirdly good at spotting wigs and spends an inordinate amount of time thinking of New Girl quotes for her felt quote board.</p>
